# Using ChatGPT API for Quiz Generation
## Lab Description: 
Traditional quiz creation methods often involve manual effort, consuming valuable time that educators could otherwise spend on interactive teaching. The AI Quiz Generator offers a compelling solution to this challenge, automating the quiz generation process and providing teachers with a tool to swiftly create quizzes tailored to individual student needs. In this lab, we invite you to explore the potential of the AI Quiz Generator by using a Jupyter notebook that leverages the OpenAI GPT-3 API. 

### Configuring OpenAI GPT-3 API

1. **Obtain OpenAI API Key**
   - Go to [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
   - Sign up or log in to your account.
   - Obtain your API key.

2. **Configure API Key**
   Open the Jupyter notebook (`PS_GenAI_Test_Generator.ipynb`) and replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Run the Quiz Generator

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Access the Notebook**
   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). Navigate to the `PS_GenAI_Test_Generator.ipynb` file.

3. **Execute the Notebook**
